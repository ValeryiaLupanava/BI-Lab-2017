#1 Firstly you need to use "first load.sql" file.
It helps you to understand load steps.
Also this file contains calling packages.
But DDL objects, packages bodies etc. you should create on your own.
All scripts are located in related folders. 

#2 Secondly you need to use "reload data.sql" file.
It helps you to reload data in the DB.
Also this file contains calling packages.
Additionally, there are new procedures what you need to reload data, especially for SCD2 type dimension.
By the way, it includes extra procedures to update data into CE tables of 3NF layer.

Good luck :)
